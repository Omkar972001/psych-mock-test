She decided to use low and high levels of illumination and three levels of duration of stimulus as 30,50 and 70 milliseconds through an electric chronoscopic instrument. The investigator used separate group design for various combination of treatments. These participants were required to press a 'Yes' button if they detect the signal or 'No' button if they do not. Each participant was given a total of 50 trials within which 10 signals were randomly presented. Proportions of hits and false alarms was computed for each participant and were analysed to get answers to research questions.",
        "passage_zimbardo": "A group of researchers were curious to understand the behaviour of guards in prisons and wanted to know whether it was due to dispositional (personality) or environment dependent (situational) factors. To study the roles of guards and prisoners they created a mock prison. 23 men unfamiliar with each other volunteered to participate in the study and were assigned the role of prisoners and guards. Both adopted to their new roles. A rebellion on the second day led to harsh retaliation by the guards. Ruthless retributive action was taken to punish the prisoners. The researchers intended to run the experiment for 2 weeks. It was however, terminated on the sixth day due to the emotional breakdown of prisoners and excessive aggression by the guards. The experiment revealed how people confirm to the social roles they are expected to play."
