Hence, they used cross sectional research and recruited 150 older adults\n(60-95 years) who were matched with 150 younger adult (17-34 years) on gender ethnicity, religion and self reported health status. Beck's scale for suicidal ideation was used to measure suicidal ideation. They used 't' test for comparison of variables and found no significant difference. According to Siegler, neither cross sectional nor longitudinal study provide much information about how those changes occur over time.
