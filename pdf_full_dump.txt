Read the following passage carefully and answer the five questions that follows: An investigator designs an experiment to see the effect of illumination level and duration of visual signal on detectability of change in illumination in a dark room on 120 randomly selected sample of college going male students. She decided to use low and high levels of illumination and three levels of duration of stimulus as 30,50 and 70 milliseconds through an electric chronoscopic instrument. The investigator used separate group design for various combination of treatments. These participants were required to press a 'Yes' button if they detect the signal or 'No' button if they do not. Each participant was given a total of 50 trials within which 10 signals were randomly presented. Proportions of hits and false alarms was computed for each participant and were analysed to get answers to research questions. 91. Identify the experimental design used (A) Randomized group (B) Single factor (C) Multifactor (D) Repeated Measures 92. What type of independent variables were included? (A) Both were fixed factors. (B) Both were random factors. (C) Illumination level was a fixed factor while the duration was a random factor. (D) Illumination level was a random factor while the duration was a fixed factor. 93.

(C) Gender and ambient illumination (D) Frequency of signal and level of illumination Read the following paragraph and answer the five questions that follows: A group of researchers were curious to understand the behaviour of guards in prisons and wanted to know whether it was due to dispositional (personality) or environment dependent (situational) factors. To study the roles of guards and prisoners they created a mock prison. 23 men unfamiliar with each other volunteered to participate in the study and were assigned the role of prisoners and guards. Both adopted to their new roles. A rebellion on the second day led to harsh retaliation by the guards. Ruthless retributive action was taken to punish the prisoners. The researchers intended to run the experiment for 2 weeks. It was however, terminated on the sixth day due to the emotional breakdown of prisoners and excessive aggression by the guards. The experiment revealed how people confirm to the social roles they are expected to play. 96. Name the Psychologist who led this research (A) Milgram (B) Zimbardo (C) Asch (D) Sherif 97. What went wrong with the experiment because of which it was terminated on the 6th day?

She wrote 120 questions trying to cover several areas of the language usage. Each question had five alternatives, out of which only one was right. The draft version of the test was given to a sample of 200 students. The test items were analyzed in two ways — carrying out item- remainder correlation and discrimination index for each item. For the purpose of computing item discrimination index, she labelled those who had a total score below P27 as low scorers, and those who had a total score above P73 as high scorers. (Assume that P27 and P73 had non-fractional. i.e. full integer values). The statistical significance of the discrimination index of each item was evaluated by appropriate test. Ninety items were retained in item analysis. The Ninety-item version was administered to a fresh sample of 400 subjects. Cronbach alpha was computed. The psychologist also wondered if she could compute Kuder-Richardson (K- R) reliability for her test. Since the Cronbach alpha was pretty high. i.e. .947. and the test was quite long. she decided to develop the two parallel forms. each of 45 items. She randomly assigned the items to two halves. labelling them as Form A and Form B. For each Form. she assessed average inter-item correlation. mean. standard deviation and Cronbach alpha. The two forms satisfied the criteria for parallel forms. 91. For computing inter-item correlations, which one of the following is suitable?

Give below are two statements: One is labelled as Assertion (A) and the other is labelled as Reason (R): Assertion (A): It is not possible to compute K-R reliability for the above test, since each item has five alternatives Reason (R): K-R reliability can be computed, when the items can be dichotomously scored In the light of the above statements, choose the most appropriate answer from the options given below: (A) Both (A) and (R) are correct and (R) is the correct explanation of (A) (B) Both (A) and (R) are correct but (R) is Not the correct explanation of (A) (C) (A) is correct but (R) is not correct (D) (A) is not correct but (R) is correct Read the following paragraph and answer the five questions that follow: An experimental psychologist wanted to test two hypotheses. The first hypothesis proposed that stress would adversely affect the rate of serial learning. The second hypothesis proposed that the type of material (meaningless vs. meaningful) would moderate the effect of stress. The psychologist formed six groups by manipulating stress (A) at three levels — Low. Moderate and High and Type of material (B) at two levels. The subjects were randomly assigned to these groups from an initial pool of subjects. The list of 15 CVC trigrams constituted meaningless material and the list of 15 three-lettered meaningful words constituted meaningful material.

Assertion (A): MRI provides images of brain activity rather than brain images  Reasons(R):   Results in MRI are obtained from the measurement   of waves that  hydrogen atoms emit   when they are activated by radio - frequency waves in a  magnetic field  In the light of the above two statements choose the correct option  (1) Both (A) and (R) are true and (R) is the correct explanation of (A)  (2)   Both (A) and (R) are true and (R) is not the correct explanation of (A)  (3) (A) is true, but (R) is false  (4) (A) is false, but (R) is true  Read the following paragraph and answer the five questions. 91   -   95   which follow'.  The experimental psychologist   wanted to explore whether the noise adversely  affects the reaction time (RT). She also wanted to explore whether the stress level  would moderate the effect of noise. She varied noise at three levels low (30)  decibels,. moderate .60 decibels and high (90 de cibels,. She varied stress at two  levels low and high. From the initial pool of college students. subjects were  randomly assigned to different groups However. a few subjects could not turn up  to the laboratory due to vacation. In all. two hundred and ninet y seven subjects  participated in the experiments. Each subject. in each group. was tested for simple  RT. disjunctive RT. and choice RT. The theory and preliminary analyses indicated the  three types of RT were moderately correlated. The covariance matrices.   showing the  co variances among the three types of RT.. were found to be quite similar for all the  groups. The multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) results were computed to  explore the group differences in means -   As the most common practice is. four   test  criteria (Pillais criterion. Wilk,'s criterion. Hotelling's crterion. and Roy's criterion)  were obtained. Among the different results obtained in this work. one interesting  finding was that the stress moderated the effect of noise level on reaction ti me.  Q•91 Which of the following test criterion is more appropriate than the others?  (1) Roy's criterion  (2) Wilk's criterion  (3) Hotelling's criterion  (9) Pillals criterion  Q.92.

A sport psychologist wanted to study the effect of a specific type of steroids. She  hypothesized   that the consumption of steroid would temporarily improve the  running rate. Seventy athletes   in the age range of 25 to 30   years were employed in  this work. Two groups, A and B, of equal   size were formed by random assignment.  The examination of the two groups revealed that the   two groups had similar  genderwise composition. Group A athletes received the drug dosage,   adjusted fo r  the body weight. Group B athletes received the placebo. Twenty - five minutes (time  required to manifest the steroid effects) after, the athletes were required to run a  specific track.  The mean time to run the track was calculated for each group. The mean   time  required to run   the track was 180 seconds and 145 seconds respectively for Group  A and Group B. The mean   difference was evaluated by appropriate statistical test.  Q - 46 Given below are two statements, one labelled as Assertion (A) and the other  labell ed as  Reason (R). in the context of the above experiment, read the statements and  choose the correct  answer using the code given below.

A researcher working in the vocational interests surveyed different interest  assessment tools and after a careful scrutiny selected 68 sca les presumably  covering all areas of vocational interests. He administered all these scales to a  large sample (N=750). The researcher correlated every scale with every other scale  and obtained correlation matrix. The correlation matrix, without altering an y of the  diagonal elements, was factor analyzed and the unrotated factors were extracted.  The cattell’s scree suggested 11 factors, where as Kaiser -   Guttman’s criterion To get free NTA NET study materials send"JOIN " Via WhatsApp 9339100300 www.aifer.in 209
--- PAGE 211 ---
suggested 14 factors for further rotation. The eleven factors explained 72 percent  of v arianve. The eleven factors were varimax - rotated. After examining the results  and discussion, the researcher decided to carry out the second - order factor  analysis. He, therefore, re - rotated the eleven factors and found that some of the  inter - factor correla tions were fairly high. The second - order factor analysis  suggested three second - order factors which were fairly interpretable.  Q - 96 Given below are two statements, one labelled as Assertion (A) and the other  labelled as  Reason (R). Read the statements and   choose the correct answer using the code  given below:  Assertion (A) : In the above work, the researcher preferred cattell’s scree - plot over  Kaiser -  Guttman’s criterion.  Reason (R) : Even with a small number of variables, Kaiser - Guttman’s criterion  always   leads to  the extraction of more factors, as compared to cattell’s scree.  Options: -  1. Both (A) and (R) are true, but (R) is not the correct explanation of (A).  2. (A) is true, but (R) is false.  3. Both (A) and (R) are true, but (R) is the correct expla nation of (A).  4.

Read   the   following   paragraph   and   answer   the   five   questions   which   follow   :  A   researcher   in   experimental   psychology   hypothesized   that   a   particular   ‘Reward  System’   for   fast   reactions   would   improve   the   reaction   time.   To   verify   this   hypothesis,  he   selected   forty   subjects   in   the   age   range   of   25   to   35   years   from   an   organization.  Following   the   standard   reaction   time   experiment,   he   measured   the   simple   reaction  time   without   the   reward   system.   While   taking   each   trial   in   the   experiment,   the   time -  interval   between   the   ready   signal   and   the   onset   of   stimulus   was   randomly   varied  between   two   to   five   seconds.   In   the   second   part   of   the   experiment,   the   rewar d  system   was   introduced   and   the   simple   reaction   time   was   measured   again   for   the  same   subjects.   The   mean   reaction   time   before   the   introduction   of   reward   system  was   210   milliseconds   and   the   mean   reaction   time   after   the   introduction   of   reward  system   was   250   m illiseconds.   The   difference   between   the   two   means   was  statistically   significant   at   .01   level.  46.

Instructions   for   questions   96   to   100   :  Read   the   following   paragraph   and   answer   the   five   questions   which   follow   :  An   educational   psychologist   wanted   to   develop   an   ac hievement   test   in   physics  for   graduate   students.   After   going   through   the   usual   test   construction   procedure,  he   retained   100   items;   each   item   having   five   alternatives,   one   of   them   being   correct.  The   psychologist   wanted   to   examine   the   factor   structure   of   the   resulting  achievement   test.   Using   a   sample   of   1,000   subjects,   the   psychologist   obtained   the  inter - item   correlations.   He   obtained   the   initial   estimates   of   communality   and  then   decided   to   factor   analyze   the   inter - item   correlations   matrix   by   following   the  co mmon - factor   model.   He   extracted   the   unrotated   factors   and   retained   the   first  nine   factors   for   rotaion.   The   nine   unrotated   factors   explained   67.5   percent   of  variance.   After   factor   rotation,   all   the   inter - factor   correlations   were   found   to   be   zero.  The   factor   structure   of   the   achievement   test   of   physics   was   found   to   be  interpretable.  96.   The   inter - item   correlations   would   be   :  97.

Read the following paragraph and answer the   five   questions which follow : A psychologist, working in the area of Learning and Memory hypothesized that a particular drug would adversely affect the learning rate. One hundred and fifty subjects, 75 boys and 75 girls, studying in the first year of a degree college, in the age range of 18 to 20 years, were available for the study. It was ensured that all the subjects were in the DIQ (deviation IQ) range of 85 to 115. Three groups - A, B and C - of equal size were formed by random assignment. Group A received high dosage of drug, Group B received moderate dosage of drug, and Group C received only placebo. A list of 15 CVC trigrams, each having an association value in the range of 50 to 70 was already prepared. Each subject was required to learn the list upto two errorless trials using method of anticipation on a memory drum. The mean trials required to learn the list were 12, 15 and 20 respectively. The intergroup mean differences were statistically significant at .01 level.

Instructions for Questions 46 to 50 :  Read the following paragraph and answer the five questions which follow :  A researcher working in the area of human intelligence wanted to develop a new  verbal test of intelligence. For this purpose, he wrote 200 objec tive multiple - choice  items. Each item had four alternatives, one of which was right and the three  remaining ones were wrong. He administered this initial version to a sample of 400  subjects. Using P 27   and P 73   as the cut - off points, he obtained two groups   –   Low  Scoring and High Scoring respectively. The item difficulty index and the item  discrimination index were computed for each of the 200 items. To assess whether  each item significantly discriminates between Low scoring and High scoring groups,  appropriat e statistical significance tests were also employed. This item analysis  process retained 150 items. The final version of 150 items was administered to a  fresh sample of 750 subjects. The appropriate measures of internal consistency  reliability were obtaine d. The test norms were developed using normalized   T  scores (mean = 100, SD = 20) and the Wechsler type deviation IQ scores. To assess  the dimensionality of verbal intelligence, the researcher also carried out the factor  analysis of item   scores.  46.   Whic h one of the following test of statistical significance can be employed in  the above study to evaluate whether the item significantly discriminates between  the Low scoring and High scoring groups   ?

He seems to be  suffering from  (1)   Borderline personality disorder   (2)   Na rcissistic personality disorder  (3)   Histrionic Personality disorder   (4)   Schizoid personality disorder  Instructions for Questions 71 to 75 :  Read the following paragraph and answer the five questions which follow :  Scaling in psychology can be classified   into two categories   –   psychophysical scaling  and psychological scaling. Although psychological scaling had its origin in  Fechner’s method of first choices and the work on colour preference, the major  work in psychological scaling began in 1920’s in the con text of attitude  measurement. Bogardus Social Distance Scale (1925) is one of such first attempts.  A major breakthrough in attitude scaling occurred when Thurstone developed his  Law of Comparative Judgement (LCJ) and also proposed the three scaling  methods - paired comparison, equal appearing intervals, and successive intervals. In  the paired comparison, every statement/stimulus is paired with every other  statement/stimulus. The computational methods of paired comparison are most  extensively developed, some o f them using Thurstone’s LCJ directly for this  purpose. Such pairing of statements/stimuli is not involved in methods of Equal To get free NTA NET study materials send"JOIN " Via WhatsApp 9339100300 www.aifer.in 328
--- PAGE 330 ---
Appearing Intervals (EAI) and Successive Intervals (SI). Moreover, the distributions  of the categories, assigned by the judges to   each attitude statement in EAI and SI  need not be normal; in fact the distributions for several statements are skewed.  This situation requires some computational precautions. Moreover, the method of  successive intervals was computationally quite laborious   in pre - computer era and  hence it was not so popular. In the classical scaling tradition Guttmann developed  the scalogram technique and Edwards developed the scale discrimination  technique. Likert’s development of summated ratings represent an important  la ndmark in attitude measurement. It follows the traditional psychometric model.  Aiken and Groth - Marnatt (2009) concluded that other scaling techniques, less  frequently used for attitude measurement, include Osgood’s semantic differential,  Q - sort, expectancy   value rating, magnitude estimation, multidimensional scaling  etc.  71.   The scale values of the attitude statements, obtained by analyzing paired  comparison data following Thurstone’s LCJ, would yield  (1)   Nominal Scale  (2)   Ordinal scale  (3)   Interval scale  (4)   Ratio scale  72.   Read each of the following two statements   –   Assertion (A) and Reason (R);  and indicate your answer using codes given below :  Assertion (A) : The method of paired comparison is not suitable for scaling the  large number   of attitude statements.  Reason (R) : In method of paired comparison, every attitude statement is paired  with every other attitude statement.  Codes :  (1)   Both (A) and (R) are true and (R) is the correct explanation of (A).  (2)   Both (A) and (R) are true,   but (R) is not the correct explanation of (A).

Job efficiency correlated with M.B.A. marks (r = 0.40),  selection test scores (r = 0.50) and the evaluation scores at the end of inhouse  training. (r = 0.60) . All the three correlations were statistically significant. The  multiple regression was   computed using job efficiency as the criterion and the  other three variables as the predictors. The three predictors explained 56.25  percent of variance in the job efficiency. The industrial psychologist further  thought that the communication skills asses sment would enhance the  predictability of job efficiency. As such, the communication skills of the To get free NTA NET study materials send"JOIN " Via WhatsApp 9339100300 www.aifer.in 373

Paragraph :   A psychometrician wanted to develop a new test of Abstract Thinking.  He prepared eighty items, presumably assessing abstract thinking. Each   item kad  five alternative answers, one of them being correct. The psychometrician carried out  item analysis by usi ng   item - remainder   correlations. Item   analysis retained   sixty  items.   To   examine   internal   consistency among the items, inter - item correlations  were inspected. Then the split - half   reliability   coefficient,   Kuder   -   Rickardson  reliability coefficient,   and   Cronba ck’s   alpha   coefficient were obtained for the sixty  item test. The analysis yielded the Cronback’s alpha coefficient of 0.90.   Since the  test was fairly long and the alpha coefficient was also quite   high,   an   attempt   was  made   to   develop   two   short   versions   of   equal   length   by   randomly   dividing the test  items. The 60 item version was, then, correlated with the already established abstract  reasonin g   test,   usin g   N = 500 .   The   correlatio n   betwee n   the   new   an d   a n   establishe d  tes t   was   0.24,   significant at .01   level.

Read the following paragraph and answer the five questions which follow :  Paragraph : Experimental personality research was extremely popular after 1950 for  about three to four decades. In experimental personality research, one of the major  focus is to st udy how the effect of experimentally manipulated independent variable  is moderated by personality variable/s. In one of such study, the researcher wanted  to study whether the effect of Interpolated learning (A) is moderated by Anxiety (B).  The researcher h ypothesized that the interpolated learning would adversely affect  the recall of original learning more in high anxious subjects than low anxious  subjects. Using a standardized Anxiety scale, from an initial pool of two hundred  subjects, fifty high and fift y low anxious subjects were obtained. Both, high as well  as low anxious groups were further divided into two groups - Experimental group  and Control group. The experimental groups first learned List A of CVC trigrams,  then learned another List   -   List B of CV C trigrams with similar association values,  and then tested for Recall (A). The subjects in control groups learned List A. Then  they received the cancellation task for the specific period (equal to the average time,  taken by the corresponding experimental   group to learn List B). The subjects were  then tested for the Recall of (A). Groupwise means and standard deviations for recall  scores were obtained.  The standard deviations were found comparable across the groups. Treating recall  scores as the   dependent variable, the appropriate ANOVA was carried out. The main To get free NTA NET study materials send"JOIN " Via WhatsApp 9339100300 www.aifer.in 416

effect of A was found significant at 0.05 level. Similarly, the F - ratio, defined as  ‘MS A3B /MS E ’ was found statistically significant at 0.01 level.  71.   Which one of the following design is   used in the above research ?  (1)   Multigroup design with single I.V. (2)   232 factorial design  (3)   232 mixed factorial design   (4)   Repeated measures design  72.   Which one of the following statement is true in the context of above study ?  (1)   The assumption of homogeneity of variance was satisfied.  (2)   The assumption of homogeneity of variance was not satisfied.  (3)   The correction for heterogeneity of variance was required.  (4)   T he data are insufficient to evaluate the assumption of homogeneity of variance.  73.   On the basis of the information provided about the main effect of A, it can be  concluded that :  (1)   Interpolated learning had no effect on the recall of A.  (2)   Interpolated learning caused retroactive interference.  (3)   Interpolated learning caused retroactive facilit ation.  (4)   Either retroactive interference or retroactive facilitation has occurred.  74.

Nos. 46 to 50 :  Read the following paragraph and answer the five questions that follow :  Psychology, as a scientific study of behaviour , employs several diverse  research methods to collect and analyse data. In the early phase of modern  psychology, experimental method   kas been   highly popular.   The early  psychologists,   like   Fechner   and   Ebbirgkaus,   were   well   -   known  experimentalists. Experimental method allows the active manipulation of the  independent variable (IV) Ronald Fisker and others systematized the area of  experimental   designs.   Due   to   the   success   of   controlled   laboratory  experiments,   field   experi ments   were   also   carried   out   where   the   IV   is  manipulated in the natural or field setting. Especially due to the need for  policy and program evaluation research, quasi   -   experimental designs have  also   been   developed.   Various   non   -   experimental   methods,   inclu ding  surveys and correlational research, are also employed in psychology. The  survey method employs interviews, both structured and unstructured, and  questionnaires. Both open   -   end and close   -   end questions and scale items  can be used in interview schedul es and questionnaires. Different types of  observations,   including naturalistic observation, participant   and   non -  participant   observation,   are also used   in   certain   areas like   ethology.   In  the   qualitative   research   tradition,   case   studies   are   widely   used.   Special  research   approaches,   for   example,   ethnographic   research,   have   been  developed   for   specialized   areas   like   cross - cultural   psychology.   In addition,  psychologists   use   various   measurement   techniques   including  standardized   objective   tests, projective methods, situational tests and  even   physiological   measures.   The   use   of   such   diverse   methods   and  measurement   techniques   kas enriched the   science   of   psychology as well  as   our   understanding   of   human   and   animal   behaviour   including   the  cognit ive   processes.

Read the following paragraph and answer the five questions that follows :  The most popular method of measuring attitudes is to administer the attitude scale.  Although Bogardus Social Distance Scale (1925) is one of the first attitude scales, a  major break through in attitude scaling was made by L.L. Thurstone who developed  the law of comparative judgement (LCJ) and also proposed the three scaling  methods   -   paired comparison, equal appearing intervals, and successive intervals.  In the paired comparison, ever y statement/ stimulus is paired with every other  statement/stimulus. The computational methods of paired comparison are most  extensively developed and use Thurstone’s LCJ directly for this purpose. Since the  paired comparison method has limitations in scal ing large number of statements/  stimuli, the two other methods   -   equal appearing intervals, and successive intervals  -   were   developed   by   Thurstone.   The   method   of   successive   intervals   was  computationally laborious in the pre - computer era and hence it was no t so popular.  In the classical scaling tradition Guttmann developed the scalogram technique and  Edwards developed the scale discrimination technique. Likert’s development of  summated ratings represent an important landmark in attitude measurement. It  follo ws the traditional psychometric model. Aiken and Groth   -   Marnatt (2009)  pointed   out   that   other   scaling   techniques,   less   frequently   used   for   attitude  assessment, include Osgood’s semantic differential, Q - sort, magnitude estimation,  expectancy value scaling,   facet analysis, multidimensional scaling etc.  71.   If eleven attitude statements are to be scaled by the method of paired  comparison, what would be the number of pairs ?

Nos. 46 to 50 : Read the following paragraph and answer t he five  questions that follow :  The research process usually begins with the identification and formulation of  research problem. Once the problem is identified, the appropriate hypotheses are  developed. The hypotheses are tentative solutions to the proble m and represent  the conjectural statements of relationship among two or more variables. The  hypotheses could be classified in various ways, such as directional vs. non -  directional, correlational vs. causal etc. Edwards classified the variables in  psycholog ical research as stimulus variables, organismic variables and behavioural  variables. The variables are classified as the continuous variables and discrete  variables, the latter having two subtypes - the real discrete variables and artificially  discrete varia bles. The variables in research need to be properly operationalized.  Robinson classified the psychological studies in four categories   –   Laboratory  experiments, Field experiments, Ex post facto field studies and Ex post facto  analysis of experiment (slightl y modified). The fourth category, on its own, is  accorded less respect but is essential for the advancement of Science.  46.   Which of the following hypothesis/hypothes are non - directional hypotheses ?  1.

Nos. 71 to 75.  Read the follo wing paragraph and answer the five questions that follow :  An anxiety researcher, working in the interaction model of anxiety, wanted to factor  analyse anxiety - producing situations. He had a hunch that anxiety - producing  situations would broadly belong to   two categories   –   inter - personal - evaluative and  physically - threatening. His tool, assessing situation - specific anxiety, had 14  situations. For each situation, the subject was required to indicate on 11 five - point  rating scales as to how he or she would resp ond in that situation. Thus for each  situation scale, the minimum score would be 11 and the maximum score would be  55. The correlation matrix among the 14 situation scales was formed. Two factor  analyses were carried out on this correlation matrix. In the   first factor analysis,  unities were retained in the diagonal spaces of the correlation matrix and the un -  rotated factors were extracted. Using Cattell’s scree plot, three factors were  retained for rotation. The rotated factors had small or moderate inter - f actor  correlations. In the second factor analysis, appropriate communality estimates  were inserted in the diagonal spaces of the correlation matrix and the three factors  were rotated using the same rotation method, used in the same factor analysis.  71.   Cattell’s scree plot is a  (A)   Plot of the order of Eigen values on X axis and the actual Eigen values of  the reduced correlation matrix on Y axis.

She wrote eighty multiplechoice items, each item with five alternatives.  The item analysis was carried out by finding discrimination index and item -  remain der correlation for each item.  Sixty items were retained in item analysis. The new version, with finally retained  sixty items was administered to a new sample (N = 400) twice with a time gap of  eight weeks. The test - retest correlation was found to be 0.22 , significant at .01  level. The data obtained at the first administration of the sixty item version was  also used for computing split - half reliability. The correlation between scores based  on odd items and the scores based on even items was found to be 0.6 0. The split -  half reliability coefficient was obtained after applying Spearman - Brown correction.  The scores obtained by the students were correlated with their marks in  Mathematics in their annual examination which took place three months after the  data co llection. The product - moment correlation of 0.6 was obtained between test  scores and mathematics. Norms were developed for the test. The normative  sample yielded a mean of 40 and standard deviation of 8. The data were found to  be normally distributed. As n orms, percentile ranks were obtained.  46.

70. Bandura’s social learning theory had the main focus on  (A) Moral Emotion  (B) Moral Reasoning  (C) Moral Behaviour  (D) Moral Emotion and Reasoning  Instruction for Q. 71 to 75 : Read the following paragraph and answer the five  questions that follow :  A researcher wanted to study the effect of a specific drug on the activity of rats. He  suspected if the effect of the d rug is moderated by temperature. He varied drug  dosage (A) at three levels - no drug (placebo), low drug dosage (5 mg/kg body - weight)  and high drug dosage (10 mg/kg bodyweight). He varied temperature (B) at two levels  –   25° Celsius and 39° Celsius. Fifteen r ats were randomly assigned to each of the six  groups. The activity scores for each rate were obtained through activity wheel. The cell  means and standard deviations for activity scores were obtained for the six cells. All  the cells had comparable standard   deviations. A suitable analysis of variance was  carried out using the activity scores as the dependent variable. One of the interesting  finding in this research was that the F ratio defined as ‘MSA × B/MSE’ was statistically  significant at .01 level.  71.

Instructions for Q. 46 to 50: Read the following passage and answer the five questions  that follow:  The Classical Test Theory (CTT) assumes that every obtained score is a sum of the  true score and the err or of measurement. The earlier versions of the CTT, in their  reliability   conceptualization,   ambitiously   addressed   the   random   errors   of  measurement.   Accordingly,   rel i ability   can   be   conceptualized   as   a   consistency  betwe en the true score and the obtained score. Reliability can be studied through  various perspectives. In the test construction phase, internal consistency reliability  is given heavy emphasis. Various reliability coefficients such as split - half reliability,  Ku der - Richardson reliability, Cronbachalpha etc. have been developed for this  purpose. One of the earlier developments in CTT is the Spearman - Brown formula.  The other important types of reliabilities include test - retest reliability and inters  corer reliabili ty.  In addition to reliability, psychologists emphasize test validity. Content validity,  concurrent validity, predictive validity, constructs validity is some of the important  types of validities in psychometric studies. Factor analysis has also been emplo yed  in evaluating the test validity. Once the reliability and validity are well established,  the test constructor attempts to establish the representative and comprehensive  norms.  47. Cronbach alpha is  1. larger than split half reliability coefficient  2. smaller than reliability coefficient  3.   Average of all possible split - half reliability coefficients  4.

alternatives to parametric methods are developed. Thus there are non - parametric  alternatives to   student’s   t   test, one - way   ANOVA   etc.   When   assumptions   are  reasonably met, parametric test s are more powerful. Certain types of tests, such as  chi - square test, use frequency data to evaluate the differences between obtained  and expected frequencies. Some associations/correlation measures have been  developed using chi - square distribution. Statis ticians like Kolmogorov and Smirnov  developed tests which involve entire frequency distribution/s. Psychologists have  profitably used these techniques in their researches 46. Which one of the following test is closest to independent samples t test from power-consideration point of view? (A) Mann-Whitney U test (B) Signed rank test (C) Chi-square test (D) Kolmogorov-Smirnov test 48.

The notion of true score is at the heart of classical reliability theory. This model  proposes that the obtained score on a variable is a sum of true score and the  random error of measurem ent, the two components being independent. Using this  model, various ways of computing reliability have been developed. One of the ways  of examining the reliability of a test is to test the homogeneity of test items or the  internal consistency. The most wi dely used method of estimating the reliability is  split half technique, also called as odd - even reliability. In this context, Spearman  Brown correction is important. Kuder -   Richardson reliability and Chronbach Alpha  are the two other methods of studying in ternal consistency.  Another important type of rel i ability is the interscorer reliability. This reliability is not  useful for objective tests, but for certain types it is quite important. There are also  other types of   reliability such as parallel form reliability and test retest reliability, the  latter concerned with temporal stability of the test results.  46. Reliability can be defined as  After applying Spearman - Brown formula  (A) The corrected   reliability would by 0.8.  (B) The corrected reliability would be 0.4.  (C) The corrected reliability would be greater than 0.4 and lesser than 0.8.  (D) The corrected reliability would be lesser than 0.4  48. Which of the following statement is true for tes ts with dichotomous items?  (A) Chronbach Alpha is greater than Kuder - Richardson reliability.  (B) Chronbach Alpha is smaller than Kuder - Richardson reliability.  (C) Chronbach Alpha and Kuder -   Richardson reliability are equal.  (D) Chronbach Alpha may be grea ter or smaller than Kuder -   Richardson reliability.  49. For which of the following types of tests interscorer reliability is relevant?  1.
