The researchers assumed that older adults are different from younger adults in their suicidal ideation
and in their reasons for thinking about committing suicide because of differences in life experiences
and coping competence. Hence, they used cross sectional research and recruited 150 older adults
(60-95 years) who were matched with 150 younger adult (17-34 years) on gender ethnicity, religion
and self reported health status. Beck's scale for suicidal ideation was used to measure suicidal
ideation. They used 't' test for comparison of variables and found no significant difference.
According to Siegler, neither cross sectional nor longitudinal study provide much information about
how those changes occur over time. He discussed a method that involves carefully observing
behavior during periods when rapid change is occurring and collecting both quantitative and
qualitative information.

Read the following passage carefully and answer the five questions that follows:
An investigator designs an experiment to see the effect of illumination level and duration of visual
signal on detectability of change in illumination in a dark room on 120 randomly selected sample of
college going male students. She decided to use low and high levels of illumination and three levels
of duration of stimulus as 30,50 and 70 milliseconds through an electric chronoscopic instrument. The
investigator used separate group design for various combination of treatments. These participants were
required to press a 'Yes' button if they detect the signal or 'No' button if they do not. Each participant
was given a total of 50 trials within which 10 signals were randomly presented. Proportions of hits and
false alarms was computed for each participant and were analysed to get answers to research questions.

Read the following paragraph and answer the five questions that follows:
A group of researchers were curious to understand the behaviour of guards in prisons and wanted to
know whether it was due to dispositional (personality) or environment dependent (situational) factors.
To study the roles of guards and prisoners they created a mock prison. 23 men unfamiliar with each
other volunteered to participate in the study and were assigned the role of prisoners and guards. Both
adopted to their new roles. A rebellion on the second day led to harsh retaliation by the guards. Ruthless
retributive action was taken to punish the prisoners. The researchers intended to run the experiment
for 2 weeks. It was however, terminated on the sixth day due to the emotional breakdown of prisoners
and excessive aggression by the guards. The experiment revealed how people confirm to the social
roles they are expected to play.
96. Name the Psychologist who led this research

(B) Zimbardo
(C) Asch
(D) Sherif
97. What went wrong with the experiment because of which it was terminated on the 6th day?

(C) The prisoners felt upset and humiliated
(D) The prisoners and guards became friends
98. The experiment:
(A) Was highly appreciated
(B) Was highly criticized

Read the following paragraph and answer the five questions that follow:
A psychologist was interested in developing English Language Usage test for HSSC students.
She wrote 120 questions trying to cover several areas of the language usage. Each question
had five alternatives, out of which only one was right. The draft version of the test was given
to a sample of 200 students. The test items were analyzed in two ways — carrying out item-
remainder correlation and discrimination index for each item. For the purpose of computing
item discrimination index, she labelled those who had a total score below P27 as low scorers,
and those who had a total score above P73 as high scorers. (Assume that P27 and P73 had
non-fractional. i.e. full integer values). The statistical significance of the discrimination index
of each item was evaluated by appropriate test. Ninety items were retained in item analysis.
The Ninety-item version was administered to a fresh sample of 400 subjects. Cronbach alpha
was computed. The psychologist also wondered if she could compute Kuder-Richardson (K-
R) reliability for her test. Since the Cronbach alpha was pretty high. i.e. .947. and the test was
quite long. she decided to develop the two parallel forms. each of 45 items. She randomly
assigned the items to two halves. labelling them as Form A and Form B. For each Form. she
assessed average inter-item correlation. mean. standard deviation and Cronbach alpha. The
two forms satisfied the criteria for parallel forms.
91. For computing inter-item correlations, which one of the following is suitable?
(A) Point biserial correlation
(B) Biserial correlation

92. Item I was passed by 30 subjects in Low scoring group and by 56 subjects in High scoring
group. What would be the discrimination index for item I?
(A) 0.241
(B) 0.481
(C) 0.556
(D) 0.796
93. Which one of the following test can be used for evaluating statistical significance of the
discrimination index?
(A) Chi-square test
(B) t test
(C) F test
(D) Mann-Whitney U test
94. What is the expected Cronbach alpha for the Form A?
(A) .474
(B) .899

95. Give below are two statements: One is labelled as Assertion (A) and the other is labelled as

Read the following paragraph and answer the five questions that follow:
An experimental psychologist wanted to test two hypotheses. The first hypothesis proposed
that stress would adversely affect the rate of serial learning. The second hypothesis proposed
that the type of material (meaningless vs. meaningful) would moderate the effect of stress.
The psychologist formed six groups by manipulating stress (A) at three levels — Low.
Moderate and High and Type of material (B) at two levels. The subjects were randomly
assigned to these groups from an initial pool of subjects. The list of 15 CVC trigrams
constituted meaningless material and the list of 15 three-lettered meaningful words
constituted meaningful material. The number of trials required to learn the list was the

2. The degrees of freedom for error variance was 135
3. The F ratio for the effect of stress was 0.95.

square.

hypothesis?

(B) that the assumption of homogeneity of variance is not satisfied

(B) Necessary for the effect of type of material
(C) Necessary both for the effect of stress and type of material
(D) Neither necessary for the effect of stress nor the type of material

Comprehension:
Read the given passage and answer the five questions which follow
A researcher wanted to predict academic achievement using Intelligence Test - A (IT-A),
Intelligence Test-B (IT-B), Type of school (rural/urban), and conscientiousness as predictors.
She used multiple regression analysis. She collected data on 200 students on all variables.
The
OLS estimator was used. The f ;8.9, p<.01 for the entire model. In individual predictor
analysis, IT-B was the insignificant predictor. The suitable test indicated homoscedasticity.
The
model R2 ;0.64 and adjusted R2; 0.59. Both intelligence tests are significantly correlated with
the criterion variable and with each other.
91. What is indicated by R2 in the passage?
(A) 64% variance is explained
(B) 80% variance is explained
(C) 32% variance is explained
