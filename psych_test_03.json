Apparently, the parents at home used to find such behavioural entertaining and laughed and enjoyed it. The psychologist drew out a programme to bring a change in Jeevan's behaviour. She first helped the parents to understand what is show off behaviour and what is not. His parents were instructed by the psychologist to avoid paying attention to Jeevans show off behaviour, the teacher was instructed to praise other children whenever anyone helped a classmates in any way. The psychologist also added that each time Jeevan manifested show-off behaviour, the loud noise of bore-well digging be played to him by the teacher. In fact, the psychologist used therapentic interventions.",

No information was available on PTG of the husbands of the patients. The researcher investigated the same factors influencing their husbands."
