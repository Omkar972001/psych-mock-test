In his study he provided two clay balls and took their agreement that the two balls are of equal size. Then he changed the shape of one ball to a flat shape in front of the children and asked which out of the two shapes contained more clay. Few children responded that the flat shape contained more clay. Later he asked another question as follows: "If an aeroplane is called an elephant, can it fly?" Few children answered "Yes it can fly". 91. The children who answered the Aeroplane-elephant question correctly come under the stage of: (A) Concrete operational stage (B) Intuitive Operational Stage (C) Formal Operational stage (D) Preoperational Stage 92.

The theory underlining the above study is: (A) Psychodynamic theory (B) Social observational learning (C) Cognitive development theory (D) Cognitive dynamic behaviour theory Read the following passage and answer the questions. An experimenter conducted a study to see the effect of social support on well being. He recruited a group of students from a school where he was working. Later he decided to see the role of gender on the relation between social support and well being. He formulated a hypothesis taking all these variables into account. The hypothesis was that the strength of the relationship between social support and well being would change when the gender variable is included. After collecting the data, normal distribution of scores was confirmed. The result was not in accordance with the hypothesis. Later the experimenter interpreted the result of the study. 96. What design was used in the above experiment? (A) Between Group Design (B) Within group design (C) Correlational design (D) Factorial design 97. What sampling was used in the study? (A) Quota sampling (B) Purposive sampling (C) Cluster sampling (D) Stratified sampling 98. What type of variable was gender in the study?
