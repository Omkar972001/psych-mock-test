To study the roles of guards and prisoners they created a mock prison. 23 men unfamiliar with each other volunteered to participate in the study and were assigned the role of prisoners and guards. Both adopted to their new roles. A rebellion on the second day led to harsh retaliation by the guards. Ruthless retributive action was taken to punish the prisoners. The researchers intended to run the experiment for 2 weeks. It was however, terminated on the sixth day due to the emotional breakdown of prisoners and excessive aggression by the guards. The experiment revealed how people confirm to the social roles they are expected to play."
