The person having panic disorder experiences recurrent unexpected attacks and must have been persistently concerned about having another attack. Most of the symptoms of panic attack are physical, although there are some cognitive symptoms also. Panic attacks are brief and intense with symptoms developing abruptly and usually reaching peak intensity within a short period. Panic attacks are often unexpected or uncued. They sometimes occur in situations in which they might be least expected such as during relaxation or during sleep. People suffer from panic disorder with or without Agoraphobia. In many studies gender difference has been found on prevalence of panic disorder. Once panic disorder develops it tends to have a chronic and disabling course. People with panic disorder have one or more additional diagnosis. It is estimated that 30 to 50 percent of people with panic disorder develops some serious other disorders.",
        "p_dec24_2": "Read the following passage and answer questions follows: Health behaviours are practiced people to maintain their health. A health habit is a health behavior that is firmly established and often performed automatically. These habits usually develop in childhood and stabilize around the age of 11 or 12. Wearing seat belt, brushing one's teeth daily, and eating a healthy diet are examples such behaviours. Although a health habit many develop initially because it is reinforced positive outcomes such a parental approval, it eventually becomes independent of reinforcement process. For example, brushing teeth automatically before going bed. Belloc and Breslow (1972) conducted a study which focused on several important health habits: sleeping 7 to 8 hours a night, not smoking, eating breakfast each day, having no more than one or two peg of alcoholic drinks each day, getting regular exercise, not eating between meals, and being no more than 10% overweight. They found that more good health people practiced, fewer illnesses they had had, better they had felt, and less disabled."
